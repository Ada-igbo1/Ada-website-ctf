<p> <u> DAY 1 </u></p> 
<p> The first day was very interesting. That was when we started building this website. 
    Met Mr. Jimi in person too on this day. Very nice guy. Also met my fellow physical learners. 
    It was fun and educating. Below is a picture from day 1.</p>

<p><u> DAY 2 </u></p>
<p> Day 2 was also very nice. 
    We all came in before classes started by 11am and we had some time to bond with each other. Classes were very nice
and interactive and this is when we started to flash out our websites. Here is a video from day 2.</p>

<p><u> DAY 3 </u></p>
